CLP software provides a C++ command-line argument parsing library to simplify
command line options offered by a C++ program. The library includes classes
for handling:

1. Help files.
2. Flags
3. Command line arguments with options.
4. Simple command line switches.

Usage:

1. Execute "waf install_headers" as root to install the headers.
2. Execute "waf build" to build a test example.
